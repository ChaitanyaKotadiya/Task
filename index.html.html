    <div class="carousel">
        <div class="carousel__item">Frankly there was nothing which you told which I didn't know. But the magic was how
            you gave perspective to
            everything.
            It was amazing.</div>
        <div class="carousel__item">Thank you so much for creating this course. I could relate with every example you
            gave with wasting my time
            in past. I was already in journey of taking charge of time and came across your video.</div>
        <div class="carousel__item"> I absolutely loved it. I realised how much I was wasting my time every day. It
            literally opened up my eyes.
            Itâ€™s something most valuable that I have learnt in my life.</div>

        <div class="carousel__item"> This course has changed my outlook of life. I must say that I like the fact that
            you
            condensed all you had
            to say in less than an hour. It was the most important one hour in my life (I really did something important
            today!). I am really motivated to schedule my days better and work towards my goals effectively without
            compromising the time I have to spend with family.</div>

        <div class="carousel__item"> My schedule has completely changed now from what it was a month back. I am
            constantly
            learning new things
            through courses and trying to upskill myself and I love the energy that I have right now to pursue the goals
            I have set for myself. And yes Warikoo sir's teachings hold a major share in this surge of force in me.
